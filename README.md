# Dynamic-Programming
This repository features two dynamic programming algorithms. The first calculates the longest palindrome in a Python list of numbers and the second solves the knapsack problem via a greedy and dynamic programming solution. Note that ```knapsack.py``` solves knapsack without repetition.
